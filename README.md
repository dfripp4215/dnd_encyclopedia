# Welcome to the D&D Encyclopedia

![Website Screenshot](./components/images/V2Screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Website Screenshot")

This website was created on react.js to be the complete Encyclopedia of Dungeons and Dragons! 

With built-in dice rollers, easy to navigate menues, search, and layout resembling the Players Hand Book, it's now easier than ever to find all your favourite D&D resources.

I want to give a quick thanks to the instructors Zara, Alex, Kasun and Alistair for their help with the project.

## Planning

I like to start by creating the basic layout of how I want the website to look - this let me get a feel of what I am about to create.

I then brainstormed what technologies I'd need to complete the work as well as the Route scructure I wanted.

Once that was set up and the routes were tested and working, I started on the CSS of the home page, as well as making the functional Dice rollers. As they both always stay on screen. 

After those were underway I'd go through each page (Spells, Monsters, Backgrounds, Ect...) implementing the API and respective links, making sure I finished the CSS of each page before moving onto the next.

Along the way I'd descover new ways of structuring my code, and incorporated that into the project.

## Future Features

* Login/Sign-up
* Friends List.
* Direct Message friends.
* Bookmarked Pages/Sections
* Session planner with invited friends.
* Customisable Dungeon Master Screen.
* Create and Save customized character sheets.
* Fall damage calculator, jump distance calculator.
* Incorporate a Map Creater where you can Create, share and 'live-edit' D&D Maps.
* Planes, Sections, Feats, Conditions, Races, Classes, Magic-Items, and Weapons incorporated from API.
* CSS improvements.

## Major Hurdles

I spent quite a long time sorting through and formatting the API data in the way I wanted it. At times I had to bulldoze my way through a problem to get something working, then coming back to find a more elegant way of getting the desired result.
